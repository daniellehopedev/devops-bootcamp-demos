# Module 15: Configuration Management with Ansible

## Ansible Setup

### Install Ansible
- installation guide: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
- install command (macos):
    - `brew install ansible`
- ansible is written in python, the installation of python is required
- can also be installed with pip

### Configure Ansible Connection to Remote Servers
- on DigitalOcean, create 2 ubuntu droplets
    - make sure python is installed on those servers
- connect ansible to the two remote servers
    - create hosts file or "inventory" file
        - file containing data about the ansible client servers
        - "hosts" meaning the managed servers
        - default location for file: /etc/ansible/hosts
    - copy the ip addresses of the remote servers to the hosts file
    - for each ip address add `ansible_ssh_private_key_file=<private-key-file-location>`
    - for each ip address add `ansible_user=root`
- test connection using some ansible ad-hoc commands
    - a fast way to interact with the desired servers `ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"`
        - `ansible all -i hosts -m ping`
    - [pattern] = targeting hosts and groups
    - "all" = default group, which contains every host
- Grouping hosts
    - can put each host in more than one group
    - can create groups that track:
        - WHERE - a datacenter/region, e.g. east, west
        - WHAT - e.g. database servers, web servers etc.
        - WHEN - which stage, e.g. dev, test, prod environment
    - at the top of a grouping of ip addresses or servers just put a name `[droplet]` or `[aws]` or `[database]`, depending on what you are using.
    - in this case it would just be `[droplet]`
    - command: `ansible droplet -i hosts -m ping`
- to address a specific server, just give the ip address or host name in the command
- configure credentials and user for a group instead of adding this separately to each ip address if they are the same, in the hosts file
    ```
    [droplet:vars]
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=
    ansible_user=
    ```

- Add ssh key file credentials in Jenkins for Ansible Control Node server and Ansible Managed Node servers
- Configure Jenkins to execute the Ansible Playbook on remote Ansible Control Node server as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- So the Jenkinsfile configuration will do the following:
    1. Connect to the remote Ansible Control Node server
    2. Copy Ansible playbook and configuration files to the remote Ansible Control Node server
    3. Copy the ssh keys for the Ansible Managed Node servers to the Ansible Control Node server
    4. Install Ansible, Python3 and Boto3 on the Ansible Control Node server
    5. With everything installed and copied to the remote Ansible Control Node server, execute the playbook remotely on that Control Node that will configure the 2 EC2 Managed Nodes
